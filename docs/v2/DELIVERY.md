# V2 foundation - delivery and evidence

Date: 2026-09-24.
Repository: `julian-passebecq/PowerToy_UI`.
Branch: `codex/power-ops-v2-workspaces`.
Draft PR: https://github.com/julian-passebecq/PowerToy_UI/pull/4

## Tested implementation

Code checkpoint: `d151051d9b40c4cde2982e2e0cffc7821b6083ca`.
Windows CI #314: https://github.com/julian-passebecq/PowerToy_UI/actions/runs/36025315380
Result: **completed / success**.
Runner: Windows Server 2025, .NET 8 SDK.

- Full WPF Release solution build: PASS, 0 warnings, 0 errors.
- Existing smoke/regression executable: PASS, all reported checks passed.
- New package-free workspace/export executable: **21/21 PASS**, 0 failed.
- The first CI attempt (#313) found a missing namespace import in the new test harness after the WPF build and old smoke suite had passed. Added the required import and reran the entire gate successfully; no failing tests were suppressed.
- Self-contained publish/artifact steps: SKIPPED by the PR workflow condition, not claimed as tested for V2.
- Native UI, mouse, monitor, clipboard, inventory interaction and idle resource measurements: NOT RUN by this implementation session.

Subsequent handoff/evidence documentation does not change the tested application code. Recheck the actual branch head and CI before running or merging; native acceptance remains separate.

## Added behavior

Named view workspaces with five presets; module visibility and grouped navigation; module tabs with search/filter state; tab keyboard commands; saved view bookmarks; inherited layout/ribbon choice; previewed layout JSON import/export; all/current/selected content JSON export; saved-sites Launchpad; on-demand local PATH/file-version inventory; in-app available/planned feature catalog.

Shell state is a separate bounded/validated schema-1 file. Business schema v7 is unchanged. Current-module and selected-module exports exclude unrelated shell views. The all-content review export can include shell state. Exports omit local launcher commands/arguments/paths by default, but free text and URLs may still be sensitive. No media bytes or complete recovery bundle is implied.

## Not implemented in this preview

Global lazy unloading of inherited editors; arbitrary widget placement/right-side companions; full per-control scroll/selection/undo restoration; multi-window-per-store coordination; complete runtime/Conda/WSL/extension/update inventory; Git/agent live feeds; cloud billing providers; AtlasNote task sync; Mongoku live summary; hardware/screen-time telemetry; RSS/market adapters; maintenance execution; credential-vault integration.

The inventory does not execute programs and does not claim a file version is the active interpreter version. The Launchpad does not run health probes or webviews. Module visibility is not a security boundary or proof of runtime unloading.

## Branch safety

The source base is the user's pushed Explorer checkpoint `df3aa1626fee3c96f6008793214852b273595ffc`. This work does not modify `main`, `codex/to-be-tested-v1`, AtlasNote, Mongoku, cloud resources or the user's laptop. PR #4 is intentionally draft and stacked on the V1 acceptance branch. No merge is authorized by this delivery.

Read `CODEX_HANDOFF.md` for a separate-worktree, unique-data-directory native test plan. Do not use the old V1-only acceptance launcher on the V2 branch. Do not overwrite the V1 results ledger.
